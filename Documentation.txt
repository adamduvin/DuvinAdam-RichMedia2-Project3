Rich Media 2 Project 3 Documentation

This was rough. I put a lot of time and effort into this project, and I don't think it shows and I'm pretty disappointed with it.

1. This site is meant as a platform for Dungeons and Dragons Dungeon Masters and Players to collaborate and see important information in order to play remotely.

2. This app was planned to have a subscription model for Dungeon Masters to pay a small fee each month to run be able to run multiple game instances and for Players to make more than 5 characters.

3. I am using react to pass information between login, main, and character creation screens. There was going to be a game screen, but I ran out of time.

4. I used MVC to store player and DM information on the server and pass it to the client.

5. I stored accounts, characters, and game instances.

6. I used Handlebars to dynamically add elements to the views.

7. I did not go above and beyond.
